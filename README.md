# Diognosis

**Source-linked medication safety and pharmacogenomics platform exploring drug interactions, metabolites, PK shifts, and genetic risk signals.**

Diognosis is a pre-v1, source-linked research prototype for exploring medication-safety mechanisms, pharmacogenomics, and evidence-backed interaction signals.

Its first module, **MedCheck Engine**, explores drug-drug interactions, pharmacogenomics, active and toxic metabolites, pharmacokinetic exposure shifts, transporter pathways, medication class effects, and source-linked evidence through a privacy-preserving static web application.

**Status:** pre-v1, under active validation, pending professional clinical review, and not medical advice.

**Data:** **Drug DB v1.2.3**.

**Live app:** [diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis](https://diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis/)

## MedCheck Engine

MedCheck Engine is the first module of Diognosis. It focuses on medication safety exploration, pharmacogenomics, drug-drug interactions, active and toxic metabolites, pharmacokinetic exposure shifts, transporter pathways, and source-linked evidence.

The MedCheck Engine runs entirely in the browser. There are no accounts, no server, no medication data collection, and no user medication or genotype data is sent to Diognosis. The graph view uses a vendored D3 build that is bundled locally at build time.

## Try A Demo

These links open the live app with example medication stacks already loaded:

| Demo | What it shows |
|---|---|
| [SSRI switch / washout](https://diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis/index.html?substances=paroxetine,fluoxetine&tab=safety) | Fluoxetine stays in the body for weeks. Adding paroxetine before it clears can keep the same cleanup pathway blocked and can stack serotonin/QT warning signals. |
| [Clopidogrel + CYP2C19 PM](https://diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis/index.html?substances=clopidogrel,omeprazole&genotype=CYP2C19:poor_metabolizer&tab=pgx) | Clopidogrel is a prodrug: the body must turn it on. A slow CYP2C19 genotype plus omeprazole can reduce activation, so the pill may give less antiplatelet effect than expected. |
| [Codeine + CYP2D6 PM](https://diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis/index.html?substances=codeine,fluoxetine&genotype=CYP2D6:poor_metabolizer&tab=pgx) | Codeine must be converted into morphine to work well. A slow CYP2D6 genotype, or a CYP2D6 blocker like fluoxetine, can leave more inactive parent drug and less pain-relieving metabolite. |
| [Simvastatin + clarithromycin](https://diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis/index.html?substances=simvastatin,clarithromycin&tab=pk) | Clarithromycin blocks one of simvastatin's main cleanup routes. Simvastatin can rise higher than intended, increasing muscle-toxicity concern. |
| [Older-adult burden](https://diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis/index.html?substances=amitriptyline,diazepam,diphenhydramine,oxycodone&tab=safety) | Each medicine can add sedation, confusion, or fall risk. The important signal is the combined burden, not only one pair of drugs. |

The deeper examples below stress cases that are often missed when a checker only looks at parent drug names. The important signal may come from an active metabolite, a toxic metabolite, a blocked clearance pathway, or a genetic no-function state.

| Deep demo | Why it is often missed |
|---|---|
| [Azathioprine + allopurinol + TPMT/NUDT15 PM](https://diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis/index.html?substances=azathioprine,allopurinol&genotype=TPMT:PM&genotype=NUDT15:PM&tab=pgx) | Allopurinol can push azathioprine down a more toxic route. If TPMT or NUDT15 cleanup is weak, the toxic 6-TGN metabolite can build up and threaten bone marrow. |
| [Capecitabine + DPYD PM](https://diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis/index.html?substances=capecitabine&genotype=DPYD:PM&tab=pgx) | Capecitabine is designed to become 5-FU. If DPYD cleanup is weak, that active cancer-drug metabolite can accumulate, so toxicity can come from the metabolite rather than the parent drug. |
| [Irinotecan + UGT1A1 PM](https://diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis/index.html?substances=irinotecan&genotype=UGT1A1:PM&tab=pgx) | Irinotecan becomes SN-38, the stronger active metabolite. UGT1A1 helps clear SN-38; if that pathway is weak, diarrhea and low-blood-count risk can rise. |
| [Bupropion + clopidogrel + nebivolol + CYP2D6 no-function](https://diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis/index.html?substances=bupropion,clopidogrel,nebivolol&genotype=CYP2D6:null&tab=safety) | This stack hides several problems at once. Clopidogrel can slow the pathway that turns bupropion into hydroxybupropion, so parent bupropion may rise. Hydroxybupropion is harder to predict: less may be made, but without functional CYP2D6, what is made may clear more slowly. Nebivolol is the clearest risk because it relies heavily on CYP2D6 for clearance; without that pathway, nebivolol exposure can climb sharply. Clopidogrel activation may also be slightly weaker if CYP2C19 is slowed, but that signal is less certain. |
| [G6PD oxidant stack](https://diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis/index.html?substances=rasburicase,primaquine,dapsone&genotype=G6PD:deficiency&tab=pgx) | These drugs look unrelated by name, but all can stress red blood cells. With G6PD deficiency, that shared stress can trigger red-cell breakdown or methemoglobinemia. |
| [Succinylcholine + BCHE/RYR1 risk](https://diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis/index.html?substances=succinylcholine&genotype=BCHE:null&genotype=RYR1:present&tab=pgx) | The issue is not a common drug-drug pair. BCHE weakness can make paralysis last too long, while RYR1 risk can point to malignant hyperthermia susceptibility during anesthesia. |

## Privacy

Diognosis currently ships the MedCheck Engine as a static client-side app. It does not use accounts, analytics, cookies, tracking pixels, backend logging, or medication-data collection. Searches, medication stacks, genotype settings, and pasted report rows stay in your browser.

There are no routine third-party runtime requests. Evidence links, demo links, and GitHub feedback links are only opened when selected.

---

## What It Shows

Most interaction checkers return isolated warnings. MedCheck Engine instead shows how a medication stack behaves as a connected system: interaction warnings, pharmacogenomics, metabolites, PK curves, evidence, receptor burden, Beers-style flags, and washout timing.

The project is intended for education, research, and review workflows. It is not a clinical decision system.

## Current Limitations

Diognosis is intentionally conservative about what it claims. MedCheck Engine PK curves use a one-compartment model or a relative exposure fallback, so they do not replace therapeutic drug monitoring, multi-compartment/nonlinear PK models, or active-metabolite clinical interpretation. Extreme exposure shifts may be capped for display clarity. Evidence marked `reviewRequired:true` is visible for review and discovery, but remains pending pharmacist or physician sign-off and should not be treated as professionally reviewed.

## How To Use

1. Open the [live Diognosis app](https://diogonmpacheco.github.io/Diognosis/).
2. Search for medications, supplements, foods, or substances.
3. Review MedCheck Engine safety, pharmacogenomics, PK, evidence, graph, burden, and washout panels.
4. Set genotype phenotypes where relevant, or paste supported PharmGx report rows in the pharmacogenomics panel.
5. Treat every result as an explanation to review, not as medical advice.

## Contribute / Review Data

Diognosis contains source-linked MedCheck Engine data. No evidence entry has been professionally reviewed yet. Entries marked `reviewRequired:true` are internally flagged enrichment rows, but the rest of the evidence should not be treated as verified.

The safety contract is simple: a warning should explain the pathway, affected actor, predicted direction, and supporting evidence. Severity should not be treated as clinically final without human review.

Helpful contributions include data review, missing evidence refs, duplicate or stale interaction reports, reproducible app bugs, and focused pull requests. Use the report links on warning and evidence cards, or start with the priority list in [Launch Data Trust Audit](docs/LAUNCH_DATA_TRUST_AUDIT.md). Cite public sources such as labels, guidelines, PubMed records, PMIDs, DOIs, or URLs, and keep entries pending professional review until an appropriate reviewer signs off.
