# MedCheck Enrichment Tooling

Dev-time literature discovery lives here. It writes review drafts only; it never edits `STUDY_DB` or the shipped bundle.

Current slice: PubMed, Europe PMC, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, and Unpaywall open-access discovery, plus optional one-hop Semantic Scholar citation/reference expansion.

```bash
node scripts/enrich/pubmed-enrich.js \
  --query "fluoxetine desipramine pharmacokinetics CYP2D6" \
  --relation fluoxetine:CYP2D6 \
  --supports fluoxetine_inhibits_CYP2D6 \
  --providers pubmed,europepmc,openalex,semanticscholar \
  --oa \
  --oa-email you@example.com \
  --limit 10 \
  --email you@example.com
```

For a citation-graph pass on the Semantic Scholar seed hits:

```bash
node scripts/enrich/pubmed-enrich.js \
  --query "fluoxetine desipramine pharmacokinetics CYP2D6" \
  --relation fluoxetine:CYP2D6 \
  --supports fluoxetine_inhibits_CYP2D6 \
  --providers semanticscholar \
  --expand-citations \
  --limit 5
```

State and outputs:

- `scripts/enrich/drafts.json`
- `scripts/enrich/novelty-index.json`
- ignored local review output: `scripts/enrich/review-report.md`
- cached legal-provider responses under `scripts/enrich/cache/`

For a curated multi-query pass:

```bash
node scripts/enrich/run-batch.js \
  --batch scripts/enrich/legal-literature-batch.json \
  --providers pubmed,europepmc,openalex,semanticscholar \
  --oa \
  --oa-email you@example.com \
  --limit 8
```

Public-facts policy:

- Paywalled or unknown-open-access papers are still useful when the abstract, PubMed record, DOI landing page, label, or guideline exposes factual findings.
- Safe-to-use public facts include identifiers, study design, sample size if public, genotype/drug directionality, public abstract-level effect sizes, broad metabolite relationships, and paraphrased conclusions.
- Full text is only required for precision upgrades: exact tables, detailed subgroup values, figures, supplementary datasets, or any claim that cannot be supported from public metadata/abstract/label/guideline text.
- Never copy protected wording, tables, figures, or full abstracts into MedCheck. Store paraphrased findings and citations instead.
- Drafts from public-only evidence must remain `verified:false` and `reviewRequired:true` until human review.

Novelty-first discovery:

- The enrichment script scores every candidate before keeping it. New PMID/DOI, new public metric sentences, missing-field matches, and saturated-topic exceptions raise the score.
- Low-novelty results are rejected into the review report with the reason, instead of being added to `drafts.json`.
- `scripts/enrich/novelty-index.json` stores saturated topics, missing fields per relation, and query-result fingerprints.
- Repeated queries with the same top results can be skipped automatically so reruns do not spend review attention on already-exhausted searches.
- Saturated topics can still accept papers when they add specific missing value: for example dose escalation, active-metabolite AUC, ancestry, rare alleles, pediatric data, metabolite ratios, or TDM/dose-model data.
- Use `--min-novelty N` to change the keep threshold for a run, or `--ignore-novelty` when deliberately auditing all provider results.

Guardrails:

- fetches only from `eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov`, `www.ebi.ac.uk`, `api.openalex.org`, `api.semanticscholar.org`, and `api.unpaywall.org`
- writes only identifiers, citation metadata, paraphrased findings, and extracted numbers
- never stores full text or verbatim abstracts
- stores legal open-access metadata only; it does not download PDFs or article full text
- dedupes by DOI, PMID, and normalized title against live `STUDY_DB` and existing drafts
- dedupes and rejects using local novelty memory before adding new drafts
- drafts use `sourceBasis:"public_metadata_or_abstract"` and remain eligible for qualitative enrichment even when the article itself is paywalled
- drafts set `needsFullTextForPrecision:true` only when public sources do not expose enough quantitative detail
- provider failures are recorded in the report without discarding successful results from other providers

Offline self-test:
