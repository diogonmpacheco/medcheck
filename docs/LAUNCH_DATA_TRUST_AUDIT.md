# Launch Data Trust Audit

Audit date: 2026-06-06

## Scope

This audit checked the generated launch bundle (`index.html`) after rebuilding from source. The pass covered drug naming, aliases, brand/generic collisions, duplicate DDI pairs, severe-pair provenance, dangling evidence references, evidence review flags, generated stats, README stats, live-app stats, and high-risk drug metadata.

## Counts

| Metric | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Drugs in `DRUG_DB` | 625 |
| Evidence entries in `STUDY_DB` | 455 |
| Public evidence entries | 453 |
| Public source-linked evidence entries | 453 |
| Pending professional review entries | 453 |
| Professional-reviewed evidence entries | 0 |
| Internal `reviewRequired:true` enrichment entries | 294 |
| Internal enrichment entries feeding graph calculations | 228 |
| Internal enrichment entries feeding DDI evidence profiles | 154 |
| Interaction pairs after fixes | 627 |
| Severe/critical interaction pairs after fixes | 323 |
| Severe/critical pairs linked only to pending-review evidence | 188 |

Note: generated stats and README intentionally count all `STUDY_DB` entries. No entry has been marked professionally reviewed yet. The `reviewRequired:true` flag is an internal enrichment/scoring control, not the boundary between reviewed and unreviewed evidence. The 188 severe/critical rows linked only to internally review-required evidence are intentionally integrated for public-preview feedback, and internal enrichment evidence contributes to graph confidence and DDI evidence-profile calculations while the whole evidence set remains visibly pending professional review.

## Check Results

| Check | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Duplicate drug names | 0 |
| Duplicate aliases | 0 |
| Brand/generic collisions | 0 |
| Duplicate DDI pairs | 0 |
| Duplicate DDI pairs with conflicting severity | 0 |
| Severe/critical DDI pairs missing `evidenceRefs` | 0 |
| Evidence refs pointing to missing `STUDY_DB` entries | 0 |
| Public entries lacking PMID, DOI, or URL unless regulatory label | 0 |
| `reviewRequired:true` entries presented as professionally reviewed | 0 |
| Generated stats mismatching source data | 0 |
| README stats mismatching generated stats | 0 |
| Live bundle stats mismatching generated stats | 0 |
| High-risk drugs lacking class/category/route metadata | 0 |

## Errors Fixed

Removed 4 duplicate DDI rows from `src/data/interactions.js`:

| Pair | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `Methotrexate + Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole` | Removed older reversed duplicate; preserved `ev_mtx_interactions_bannwarth1996` on the retained row. |
| `Warfarin + Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole` | Removed older reversed duplicate; preserved `ev_warfarin_abx_lane2014` on the retained row. |
| `Lisinopril + Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole` | Removed older reversed duplicate with no linked `STUDY_DB` ref; retained newer label-backed row. |
| `Dronedarone + Dabigatran` | Removed stale enrichment duplicate; preserved `ev_dabigatran_dronedarone_fda` on the retained row. |

After rebuild, `KNOWN_DDI` dropped from 631 to 627 rows, severe DDI rows dropped from 326 to 323, and duplicate-pair count dropped from 4 to 0.

## Remaining Professional Review Work

The remaining queue is expected launch review work, not a structural data failure. All public evidence is pending professional review:

| Queue | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Public evidence entries pending professional review | 453 |
| `reviewRequired:true` evidence entries | 294 |
| Internal review-required entries with PMID, DOI, or URL | 294 |
| Pending-review entries accidentally marked professionally reviewed | 0 |
| Pending-review entries hidden from evidence UI badges | 0 |

The internal `reviewRequired:true` subset identifies enrichment entries that still need source-faithfulness review before they can affect scoring. It does not imply the other entries are professionally reviewed. The highest-priority items are those linked to the greatest number or severity of DDI rows.
