# Diognosis Changelog

## v0.1.0-alpha.1 — 2026-06-10

### First Public Technical Preview

- Starts Diognosis public pre-v1 versioning at `v0.1.0-alpha.1` after the platform rename and LinkedIn/GitHub positioning cleanup.
- Keeps MedCheck Engine as the first module name while presenting Diognosis as the broader source-linked medication safety and pharmacogenomics platform.
- Preserves the historical `v3.x` entries below as internal engine-development milestones before the public alpha line.

## Unreleased — 2026-06-04

### Launch Hardening

- Renamed the broader platform from the working name MedCheck to Diognosis, preserving MedCheck Engine as the first medication-safety module.
- Added a deep pre-v1 launch QA audit covering five uncommon/hard scenarios: thiopurine/allopurinol marrow toxicity, capecitabine/DPYD fluoropyrimidine toxicity, irinotecan/UGT1A1 SN-38 toxicity, G6PD oxidant hemolysis, and succinylcholine BCHE/RYR1 anesthesia risk.
- Made the launch QA audit assert panel hygiene: visible panels must render content and hidden panels must not retain stale text from previous stacks.
- Added contextual GitHub feedback links to warning and evidence cards so external reviewers can report data/evidence issues with stack and evidence context.
- Added the public trust model document and `npm run launch:v1` final launch gate.
- Updated launch audit, sitemap, release date, and generated stats to match the current bundle.
- Expanded CI from basic smoke checks to the full release gate, evidence ledger check, severity report freshness check, and genotype gap audit.
- Made the severity report deterministic by tying its generated header to the app release date instead of wall-clock time.
- Hardened the DNA / PharmGx importer for direct gene-to-status JSON profiles, short phenotype labels, underscore labels, and explicit skipped-row reporting.
- Added regression coverage for direct genotype profile imports across CYP, transporter, detox, and risk-marker examples.
- Added compact evidence-card badges for curated evidence versus entries that still need human review.

---

## v3.5.5 — 2026-06-03

### Launch Preparation: Trust, Provenance, And Local PharmGx Import

- Added local DNA / PharmGx report paste-in for supported phenotype and risk-allele rows.
- Synchronized legacy genotype state with the newer `activeGenotype` model so URL demos, manual selectors, PK/fold models, and imports agree.
- Quarantined unreviewed enrichment drafts and exposed verified vs review-pending evidence counts in generated stats.
- Added a severe-pair provenance evidence batch and linked severe DDI rows to structured evidence refs.
- Updated the local evidence ledger so strict validation covers the newly added PMIDs.
- Rebuilt README stats, release metadata, severity reports, and the generated single-file `index.html`.
- Release gate passes build, metadata, database audit, regression, smoke, strict validation, and whitespace checks.

## v3.4.0 — 2026-05-26

### Phase F: Weighted Propagating Confidence & Convergence Detection

**New engine additions in `src/engine/pathwayEngine.js`:**

**`EDGE_TYPE_BASE_WEIGHT`** — structural reliability weight per edge type, independent of evidence tier. Captures mechanistic certainty: `SUBSTRATE_OF=0.92` (biochemical fact), `INHIBITS=0.85`, `METABOLIZED_TO=0.88`, `PRODUCES=0.68` (probabilistic phenotype inference). This is a second layer on top of `computeEdgeConfidence()` which handles study-tier weighting.

**`PHENOTYPE_SEVERITY_WEIGHT`** — clinical urgency multiplier per phenotype node. Applied during impact scoring to prioritize life-threatening outcomes: `serotonin-syndrome-risk=1.6`, `qt-prolongation-risk=1.5`, `respiratory-depression-risk=1.5`, `seizure-risk=1.4`, `bleeding-risk=1.3`. Efficacy loss (`analgesia_phenotype=0.85`) ranks below harm pathways at equal confidence.

**`computeHopConfidences(eff, graph)`** — re-traces a traversal path and returns per-hop confidence objects: `{edgeConf, cumConf, fromName, toName, edgeType}` for each step. Used by the cascade renderer to display decay at every hop, not just the final terminal confidence.

**`rankPathsByImpact(effects)`** — scores each path as:
```
impactScore = confidence × severityWeight × geometricMean(edgeBaseWeights)
```
Geometric mean rewards short reliable paths over long uncertain ones. Validated:
- 80% conf → serotonin-syndrome-risk (severity 1.6) → impact 97
- 80% conf → analgesia_phenotype (severity 0.85) → impact 63

**`traverseWithConvergence(maxDepth)`** — runs `traverseEffects()` from all active source nodes (drugs + immediate metabolites), groups results by terminal node, and identifies **convergence points**: ≥2 independent drug sources reaching the same phenotype. Combined probability uses: `P = 1 − Π(1 − P_i)` (independent path OR formula). Returns `{bySource, convergencePoints, allEffects}`.

**`buildClinicalSummary()`** — single entry point for the cascade render layer. Integrates Phase B enzyme capacities, convergence detection, per-drug impact-ranked paths, and high-risk path extraction (confidence > 40% + severity ≥ 1.3). Returns `{drugSummaries, convergencePoints, allEffects, highRiskPaths, enzymeCapacities}`.

**Render update (`src/ui/renderCascade.js`):**
- **Section 1 — Convergence Alerts**: prominently shows multi-drug convergence to same phenotype with combined confidence, contributing drug list, and impact score
- **Section 2 — Per-drug paths**: grouped by drug, ranked by impact score, showing per-hop confidence badges (green ≥80%, amber 60–79%, red <60%)
- **Impact score badge** on each path card
- **Direction badge**: ↑ elevated / ↓ reduced concentration
- New CSS: `cs-convergence-card`, `cs-conv-*`, `cs-hop-conf`, `cs-impact-score`, `cs-dir-badge`, `cs-drug-group`, `cs-section-header`
- Graph stats footer now shows convergence point count

---

## v3.3.0 — 2026-05-26

### Phase E: Repeated-Dosing & Steady-State PK Simulator

**New engine functions in `src/engine/pkEngine.js`:**

**`PK_DOSE_INTERVALS`** — clinical dosing interval lookup table (hours) for all 15 PK_PARAMS drugs.

**`pkGetTau(drugName)`** — resolves dosing interval for a drug by name.

**`pkSteadyStateCurve(params, tau, nPoints)`** — exact Css(t) within one dosing interval using the superposition formula:
```
Css(t) = A·(ka/(ka−ke)) · [exp(−ke·t)/(1−exp(−ke·τ)) − exp(−ka·t)/(1−exp(−ka·τ))]
```
Degenerate case (ka ≈ ke) handled separately.

**`pkRepeatedDoseCurve(params, tau, nDoses, nPoints)`** — superposition of N single doses. Each point at global time T is the sum of all prior single-dose contributions: `C(T) = Σ C_single(T − n·τ)`.

**`pkSteadyStateMetrics(params, tau)`** — returns `{ cmax_ss, ctrough_ss, accum, tmax_ss, t_to_ss_h, t_to_ss_days }` where:
- `accum = R = 1/(1 − e^(−ke·τ))` — accumulation factor
- `ctrough_ss` — trough concentration at end of interval (just before next dose)
- `t_to_ss_days` — ~5 half-lives, the time to reach 97% of true steady state

Validation results:
```
Paroxetine:   R=2.07×, SS in 4.4 days  (t½=21h, τ=20h)
Fluoxetine:   R=3.7×,  SS in 11 days   (t½=53h, τ=24h)
Amiodarone:   R=58×,   SS in 200 days  (t½=960h, τ=24h — notorious tissue accumulator)
```

**`pkInteractionAdjustedParams(params, fold)`** — returns modified params with `halfLife × fold`. Returns `null` if fold ≤ 1.1 (no meaningful adjustment). Half-life extends proportionally to AUC increase (same Vd, reduced clearance model).

**`pkGetInteractionFold(drugName)`** — looks up `calcFold()` for the drug's primary CYP enzyme given the active stack. Returns fold for use in adjusted-curve display.

**Render update (`src/ui/renderPK.js`):**
- Displays **5-dose repeated-dosing buildup curve** instead of single-dose curve
- **Dashed Cmax_ss and Ctrough reference lines** overlaid on the SVG
- **Interaction-adjusted curve** shown in amber when a CYP inhibitor is active (with fold badge)
- **Metrics row**: accumulation factor R, SS Cmax, SS Ctrough, time to steady state
- Updated CSS: `pk-metrics`, `pk-int-badge`, `pk-int-metric`, `pk-note`, `pk-warning`, `pk-taper`, `pk-sex-range`, `pk-disclaimer`

**Build bugfix in `build.js`:** Switched template injection from `template.replace(placeholder, string)` to `template.replace(placeholder, () => string)`. The string form interprets `$&` in the replacement as "insert matched text", which corrupted `highlight()`'s `"\\$&"` regex call.

---

## v3.2.0 — 2026-05-26

### Phase B: Deterministic Enzyme Capacity Model

**New engine: `computeEnzymeCapacity(enzyme, stack)`**

Replaces the previous per-substrate fold-lookup with a full global enzyme state model. Returns a structured capacity object for every enzyme in the active stack.

Formula: `capacity_pct = 100 × genotypeFactor × Π(1/INH_MULT[inhibitor]) × Π(1/IND_MULT[inducer]) × (1 − substrateBurden)`

Fields returned: `enzyme`, `capacity_pct`, `genotype_factor`, `genotype_phenotype`, `inhibitors[]` (per-drug, per-mechanism breakdown), `inducers[]`, `substrate_burden`, `affected_substrates[]`, `limiting_factor` (plain-English), `clinical_note`, `confidence`.

Example outputs:
- CYP2D6 PM + Paroxetine + Fluoxetine → **1% capacity** (near-zero; all substrates at extreme risk)
- Rifampin → CYP3A4 **667% capacity** (strong induction; substrates under-dosed)
- Digoxin alone → CYP2D6 **100%** (P-gp substrate only; correct no CYP effect)

**New engine: `computeAllEnzymeCapacities(stack)`**

Aggregates all enzymes touched by the active stack, sorted by severity (most impaired first). Feeds into the Enzyme Burden UI section.

**`findInteractions()` updated**

Every interaction object now carries `enzymeCapacity: EnzymeCapacity | null` — the full capacity state for its affected enzyme. UI can show "CYP2D6 at 1% capacity (PM + Paroxetine MBI + Fluoxetine)" alongside the fold number.

**Verified by 9-test suite** (TC1–TC6: Paroxetine NM, PM+double-inhibitor, Rifampin induction, Digoxin CYP isolation, multi-enzyme stack sort, interaction annotation)

---

### Phase C: Receptor Occupancy Aggregation

**New data: `RECEPTOR_SCORES`** — per-drug receptor affinity scores (0–3 scale) for 11 receptors across ~55 drugs:
- SERT, NET, DAT (monoamine transporters)
- H1, M1, alpha1, D2 (receptor targets)
- hERG (cardiac K+ channel)
- GABA, muOp, MAO (synaptic/oxidase)

Sources: receptor binding Ki/IC50 data, clinical toxidrome criteria, FDA labels, PharmGKB profiles.

**New data: `SYNDROME_RULES`** — 8 clinical syndrome definitions with mathematical thresholds:
1. Serotonin Syndrome (SERT ≥3 + any MAO, or SERT ≥4)
2. NE Toxicity / Hypertensive Crisis (NET ≥4 or NET+MAO ≥2)
3. QTc Prolongation / TdP (hERG ≥3)
4. Anticholinergic Syndrome / Delirium (M1 ≥4)
5. CNS / Respiratory Depression (GABA + muOp ≥4)
6. Orthostatic Hypotension / Falls (alpha1 ≥4)
7. Excessive Sedation (H1 + GABA ≥5)
8. Dopaminergic Excess / Agitation (DAT ≥3 + MAO ≥1)

**New engine: `computeReceptorOccupancy(drugNames)`**

Returns cumulative burden across all receptors, per-drug breakdown, active syndromes with driving drugs named, receptor leaders (which drugs dominate each receptor), and plain-English summary with clinical action notes (Hunter Criteria for serotonin syndrome, Beers for anticholinergic, naloxone recommendation for opioid+benzo).

---

### Phase D: Evidence Normalization — Full Provenance Model

Severity may no longer be displayed without evidence provenance. All three new functions enforce this contract.

**New function: `normalizeEvidence(interaction, studies)`**

Produces a full `EvidenceProvenance` object from any interaction + its STUDY_DB entries:
- `sourceType` — best available study type
- `studyCount` — total supporting studies
- `confidence` — calibrated 0–1 weight (EVIDENCE_WEIGHT-based, with corroboration bonus)
- `reproducibility` — `'established'|'replicated'|'single'|'conflicting'`
- `humanData` — true if any clinical study supports it
- `genotypeSpecific` — true if evidence stratified by genotype
- `lastReviewed` — most recent supporting study year
- `contradictions` — directly contradicting study IDs
- `provenance_note` — human-readable summary string

**New function: `getEvidenceSummary(drug1, drug2, enzyme)`**

Returns a display-ready provenance string, e.g.:
`"3 studies (RCT, CLINICAL PK, IN VITRO) · AUC ×4.8 · Confidence 85% · Genotype-stratified · PMID:14730412"`

**New function: `assertEvidencedSeverity(severity, drug1, drug2, enzyme)`**

Safety guard: automatically downgrades `'severe'` → `'moderate'` if confidence < 30% and emits a console warning with full provenance. Prevents false-confidence severity inflation.
